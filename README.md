(it may take about a minute to load the page because stock information loading is delayed.

#1 I Implemented Front-End website using Angular.<br>
#2 Django and Django Rest Framework is used for back-end environment.<br>
#3 For UI, Bootstrap 4 and Font Awesome 4 were used. HighCharts, Pandas were also used to display charts.<br>
